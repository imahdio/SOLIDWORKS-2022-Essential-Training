# Basic Part Modeling
## Creating sketches
>-if you have a enclosed boundary inside of another enclosed boundary it creates what's called an Island. And it just creates the material between the two enclosed boundaries.

idiosyncrasy-a mode of behaviour or way of thought peculiar to an individual, a strange or unusual habit, way of behaving, or feature that someone or something has

vertex-the highest point

isometric projection-It is a method for visually representing three-dimensional objects in two dimensions in technical and engineering drawings

union-the act or the state of being joined together
## Understanding relationships
perpendicular-at an angle of 90Â° to a given line, plane, or surface or to the ground

collinear-lying in the same straight line

coincident-happening at the same time
## Using the Extrude feature
>-Blind extrude: Defines the distance or length extrusion with a numerical value  
-Solidworks draft is features tool which used to create tapered faces on specified angle, using a netural plane or parting line.

workhorse-a horse used for work on a farm, a machine, piece of equipment, or vehicle that you can trust to work well and that you can use to do a lot of work

arsenal-a collection of weapons

isometric-isometric drawing uses a method of drawing a shape with three dimensions using two dimensions

in context-Considered together with the surrounding words or circumstances

vertex-The highest point of something

plane-a flat or level surface

offset-the amount or distance by which something is out of line

tie something to something-to show how one thing is connected to another

fancy-decorative or complicated

majority-more than half of a total number or amount; the larger part of something
## Using the Extruded Cut feature
>-cut thgrough up to the next, means cut through everything I see, up to the next face I see  
-cut up to a vertex, means cut up to that clicked point

how far-to what distance, extent, or degree
## Creating revolved features
>-if you don't want something to actually be used in the feature, you can change it from a regular geometry to construction geometry.

symmetrical-made up of exactly similar parts facing each other or around an axis

revolve-to move or cause something to move around a central point or line

hollow-having a hole or empty space inside

conic-having the shape of a cone

cone-a shape with a flat, round or oval base and a top that becomes narrower until it forms a point

nested-placed one inside the other
## Making revolved cuts
fire sth up-to start a machine, piece of equipment, computer program, etc.

cut away-To cut two things apart
## Applying materials, colors, and finishes
>-appearances not going to change the physical properties of the parts themselves. They're just going to change the way they look

rubber-a sticky, elastic solid which is produced from a milky liquid known as latex obtained from various types of rubber trees

decal-a picture or design on special paper, which can be put onto another surface, such as metal or glass

purly-in a pure manner; without admixture; merely; only; solely

beach ball-a large inflatable ball used for playing games on the beach
## Finding mass properties
mass density-mass per unit volume

kettlebell-a heavy rounded object with a handle, used for exercise

arbitrary-based on random choice or personal whim, rather than any reason or system

Back out of something-withdraw from

Finite element analysis (FEA)-It's a computerized method for predicting how a product reacts to real-world forces, vibration, heat, fluid flow, and other physical effects
## System options, units, and templates
pertain to sth-to be connected with a particular subject, event, or situation

to prompt someone to do something-to make them decide to do it

pull up something-to get information, esp. on a computer screen

the nitty gritty-the basic facts of a situation

annotation-the act of adding short explanations or notes

swap-to give something and be given something else instead

back and forth-moving first in one direction and then in the opposite one
## Working with dimensions
fillet-trims away the corner at the intersection of two sketch entities to create a tangent arc [(more info about fillets & rounds)](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2019/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/files/GUID-357499AE-7EF5-4228-8DE9-7FA6A8F11C27-htm.html)
## Selecting colors
illumination-light

luminosity-the state of producing or reflecting bright light

follow-to move behind someone or something and go where he, she, or it goes
## Creating reference coordinate systems
triad-three related things that form a group

robust

definitive-certain and unlikely to change
