# SOLIDWORKS Quick Start
## Creating your first 3D part
fine details-very delicate, small, or exact

spatially-in a way that relates to the position, area, and size of things

orientation-the position of something in relation to its surroundings

I'mma-I'm gonna, I'm going to

as far as-to the extent that

enclosed-surrounded or closed off on all sides

boundary-an edge or limit of something

extrude-to form something by forcing or pushing it out, especially through a small opening

recap-to repeat the main points of something that has been discussed earlier at the end of a meeting or talk

go back in time-return to an earlier point in time

wild-uncontrolled
## Building your first assembly
out loud-If you say or read something out loud, you say or read it so that other people can hear you, aloud, audibly

slide-to (cause to) move easily and without interruption over a surface

concentric-Concentric circles and rings have the same centre

Coincident-Two lines or shapes that lie exactly on top of each other.

more than likely-very probable or likely

ahead of time-at an earlier or previous time, in advance, beforehand
## Making your first CAD drawing
there it is-that is the situation

pull up something-to get information, esp. on a computer screen

projection-a calculation or guess about the future based on information that you have

put-to place in a specified position

call out-to announce something

fill out-to write or type information in spaces that are provided for it

bet-If you say you bet (someone) that something is true or will happen, you mean you are certain that it is true or will happen

pull-to move something towards yourself, sometimes with great physical effort

associative-involves connections between things
# Basic steps for 3D modeling
>-the basic steps for creating a model inside of SolidWorks  
>steps|description
>-|-
>1- select a face or plane|choose one of the three fundamental face or planes to get started with
>2- start a new sketch|-
>3- Draw geometry|-
>4- Tie geometry to the origin|to know where it is in space
>5- Add relations and dimensions|everything is fully defined and black
>6- create the feature|whatever it's going to be like extrude, cut or revolve
>
>Notice: there's some more advanced features that might not use these exactly, but, in general, we're going to go ahead and follow these six steps for most of our modeling.  
>-View cube= press spacebar
>-*based on study friend opinion*, here is the diffrences of centerline with regular line
>* Regular line draw any shape like rectangle
>* Centrline is not draw any shape
>* Centerline is not effect on the drawing

tie something to something-to show how one thing is connected to another

entity-a thing with distinct and independent existence

coincident-happening at the same time

underdefined-Inadequately defined

turn up-If a better situation or an opportunity to do something turns up, it happens or becomes available unexpectedly or in a way that was not planned

What's going on here-What has happened or is currently happening

snap-to move into a position quickly

snap something on-to attach something to something else

snap-on-a snap-on part of something can be fastened on and removed easily
