# SOLIDWORKS Quick Start
## Creating your first 3D part
fine details-very delicate, small, or exact

spatially-in a way that relates to the position, area, and size of things

orientation-the position of something in relation to its surroundings

I'mma-I'm gonna, I'm going to

enclosed-surrounded or closed off on all sides

boundary-an edge or limit of something

as far as-to the extent that

extrude-to form something by forcing or pushing it out, especially through a small opening
## Building your first assembly
concentric-Concentric circles and rings have the same centre

out loud-If you say or read something out loud, you say or read it so that other people can hear you, aloud, audibly

more than likely-very probable or likely
## Making your first CAD drawing
projection-a calculation or guess about the future based on information that you have

call out-to speak in a loud voice

pull-to move something towards yourself, sometimes with great physical effort

associative-of or involving the association of things
# Basic steps for 3D modeling
>-the basic steps for creating a model inside of SolidWorks  
>steps|description
>-|-
>1- select a face or plane|choose one of the three fundamental face or planes to get started with
>2- start a new sketch|-
>3- Draw geometry|-
>4- Tie geometry to the origin|to know where it is in space
>5- Add relations and dimensions|everything is fully defined and black
>6- create the feature|whatever it's going to be like extrude, cut or revolve
>
>Notice: there's some more advanced features that might not use these exactly, but, in general, we're going to go ahead and follow these six steps for most of our modeling.  
>-View cube= press spacebar

tie something to something-to show how one thing is connected to another

entity-a thing with distinct and independent existence

coincident-happening at the same time

underdefined-Inadequately defined

What's going on here-What has happened or is currently happening

snap-to move into a position quickly
