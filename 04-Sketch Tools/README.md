## Line and Centerline tools
polygon-a flat shape with three or more straight sides

identically-in a way that is exactly the same, or very similar

tie into (something)-To connect to or associate with something

uniform-the same; not changing or different in any way

diamond-a shape with four straight sides of equal length, forming two opposite angles that are wide and two that are narrow
## Using the Rectangle tool
slide around-To move around (some area) while maintaining smooth, continual contact with the ground

snap-to move (something) or change into a new position quickly

parallelogram-a four sided plane rectilinear figure with opposite sides parallel
## Circles and arcs
>-tangent arc is always going to be tangent to the starting point and I can define where I want to be.

tangent-a straight line or plane that touches a curve or curved surface at a point but does not intersect it at that point

heads up-a short talk or statement giving information on how a situation or plan is developing

draw out-to make something continue longer than usual

tangency-the state of being tangent
## Drawing slots
sneaky-secretive
## Working with ellipses and conics
ellipse-It's the set of all points on a plane whose distance from two fixed points F and G add up to a constant. [visual definition](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/ellipse.html)

cone-It tapers smoothly from a flat base (frequently, though not necessarily, circular) to a point called the apex or vertex [visual definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone)

conic-relating to a cone

Parabola-It's a curve where any point is at an equal distance from: a fixed point (the focus), and a fixed straight line (the directrix) [visual definition](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/parabola.html)

tight-fixed, fastened, or closed firmly
## Sketching polygons
inscribed-To draw on the inside of, just touching but never crossing the sides. [visual definition](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/inscribe.html)

circumscribe-If you circumscribe a triangle, square, etc., you draw a circle that surrounds it and touches each of its corners
## Creating text
scientific-careful and using a system or method

eyeball-

line up-arrange a number of people or things in a straight row

spline-It's a special type of smooth curves that pass through given data points

stand out-to be very noticeable
## Using equations and linked variables
pull up something-to get information, esp. on a computer screen

tie in-to bring into or have a connection

Trigonometry-It's a branch of mathematics that studies relationships between side lengths and angles of triangles

intricate-very complicated or detailed
## Using the Spline tool
twist-turn it to make a spiral shape, for example by turning the two ends of it in opposite directions

curvature control-allows us to control the radius of curvature at a certain point on our spline
## Equation driven curve
driven-past participle of drive, operated, moved, or controlled by a specified person or source of power
## Sketch Ink
free form-not having or following a particular style or structure

chamfer-a cut on the edge or corner of something that makes it slope slightly rather than being perfectly square [visual explanations and diffrences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRArjSKN2k0&ab_channel=ArtOfAkrosh)

protractor-a device used for measuring and drawing angles. It is usually in the form of half a circle made from transparent plastic with degrees printed on it

be overlaid with sth-Something that is overlaid with something has a particular quality added to it that influences its character
## Copying and patterning sketch text
