## Learn 3D CAD modeling using SOLIDWORKS 2022
>-two dimensional sketches will become the foundation for 3D objects

up to speed-If you are up to speed with a subject or activity, you have all the latest information about it and are able to do it well.

SOLIDWORKS sketch-It is the basis for a 3D model

extrude-to form something by forcing or pushing it out, especially through a small opening

SOLIDWORKS extrude-It extrudes the boundary edges of a face of a solid body or edges of a surface body in a customized direction

evolve-develop gradually

SOLIDWORKS sweep-It is a powerful tool to create useful geometry when a regular boss wonâ€™t work

SOLIDWORKS loft-It generates complex geometry in a single feature

suite-a series of items intended to be used together; set

best practice-commercial or professional procedures that are accepted or prescribed as being correct or most effective

robust-strong and unlikely to break or fail

assembly-the process of putting together the parts of a machine or structure, or the thing produced by this process

itemized-if a bill, bank statement, etc. is itemized the things are listed separately usually including details about each one
